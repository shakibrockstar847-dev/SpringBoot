##Only these two deendencies were added to the start:-
1) Spring web is the base dependency as we will be using the rest api here
2) H2 - inmemory databse

##After as we were encountering starting and stopping server so we will addd dev tools dependencies which will auto detect most of the changes do
1) Spring dev tools

##Only above 2 dependencies he added to start with then later he added the below dependencies

##Before start using the H2 databse he told to add spring data jpa as dependency in the project
1) Sprin data jpa

##For validation in entity file he added a new dependency
1) Springbootstartervalidation

##We have added another dependency for spring junit test which is
1)spring-boot-starter-test

##There can be many ways we can bifercate the external application.properties bases on different profiles
1) By using the separate name altogether for application.properties file ie application-LOCAL.properties or application-Dev.properties and sending the details using
i). Command line (most common)
java -jar your-app.jar --spring.profiles.active=LOCAL

ii). Maven (Spring Boot plugin)
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=LOCAL

2)By using the spring.active.profile=dev or local directly inside your application.properties file and the name of the file would be normal ie application.properties
-->Mostly 1st method is preferred y the company more.
-->Basically we have multiple db configuration for each profile so we have tried demonstrating that using @Profiles in application.yml


#Now he has added another dependency for actuator
1)spring-boot-starter-actuator
